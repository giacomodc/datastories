Direct observation of the goods vehicles can give us a lot of information regarding: the amount of pollution it generates, which company owns it and which company operates it (not necessarily the same). We have collected data on the type of the vehicle and the model, whether it is refrigerated, any logo or branding displayed. We have observed the loading factor (how 'full' is the truck) as well as counted the number of workers operating it. Finally, we use the car plate of a vehicle as a unique identifier, although they are not reported in the study for privacy concerns. Further, the information regarding the side plate has been used to extract other information (origin of the vehicle trip, type of company operating the vehicle etc.), while the original name of the company as written in the side plate will not be used.
