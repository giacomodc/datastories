The agents that perform the delivery, pickup or service are usually the drivers of the goods vehicles or the helpers. These agents often are responsible for taking operational decisions regarding the deliveries such as, routing, priorities, time of delivery as well as are those who might decide to abandon the queue, to park on the street, or to leave the area and come back later on.

Only through driver surveys we can obtain information regarding the origin and destination of the goods, the utilization of the vehicle (loading, number of stops in a day etc.), the business model behind the logistics operations we are observing as well as obtaining behavioural insights regarding the parking and driving behaviours.
