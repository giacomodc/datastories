Truck drivers and helpers, after having parked the goods vehicle, start a **handling process** Handling consists in performing one or more **deliveries**. Each delivery consists in carrying a certain amount of goods from the location where the vehicle parked to the receiver or receivers' locations. We have collected several variables describing single deliveries, some have been collected by observing the handling process, others have been obtained interviewing the driver.

Note: a goods vehicle that parked in the premises of an establishment does not necessarily perform a delivery. Some vehicles might instead pick-up goods or perform some form of service (maintenance, garbage collection, vehicles carrying people etc.). We have collected data on these vehicles as well, although no actual delivery is performed.
