This website is the result of the IDA - SUTD collaboration in an effort to understand freight-generated traffic in metropolitan areas and explore the concepts of **in-mall goods distribution system** and **Urban Consolidation Centre** in Singapore.

The concept of in-mall goods distribution system consists in the creation of a central goods receiving station in a retail mall, receiving and consolidating goods deliveries to retailers within the mall. In the absence of a centralised receiving station, each carrier have to independently walk to the store with the deliveries. An in-mall distribution system is expected to reduce handling time and congestion at loading bays. An Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) have the same function of a central receiving station as in the in-mall distribution, with the difference that the central receiving station is placed in a different location than the one of the mall, hence further reducing the number of arrival trucks at the mall, tackling congestion at the mall and in its premises.
            
The aim of this interface is to provide:
* Meaningful data to support the planning of urban freight systems.
* Better understanding of In-Mall distribution.
* Insights on the current challenges for an effective In-Mall distribution system.
           
The project is currently on data analysis phase. System modelling and design recommendations will be included in later stages.

### Objectives
The primary question we would like to answer is: what is the current state of the system? Where by 'system' we mean the bundle of processes involved before, during and after a goods vehicle has delivered, picked-up goods or performed some form of service at a large retail establishment. Such processes usually start with the cruising for parking and parking of the vehicle, then followed by the 'handling operations' (loading, unloading of goods delivery inside the mall, picking-up goods or performing a service). Such processes are fundamental for the realization of the logistics process, of the very last meters of a delivery. These very last meters are often the most 'inefficient' distance covered by the logistics process, where several inefficiencies arise due to congestion of freight vehicles, long handling times, lack of resources and space for performing loading and unloading, as well as generating several externalities to the neighbourhood and among tranport operators.

### Phases
**1. Data collections:** Collect data at large retail establishments and commercial urban areas.

**2. Data analysis:** Identify and quantify potential externalities and economic inefficiencies caused by freight traffic at large retail establishments.

**3. Modeling:** Model the processes involved in the parking and handling operations at large establishments. Identify suitable urban logistics initiatives which can possibly tackle the externalities identified and simulate their effects using the identified methodology.
